# 🚀 Terraform AWS Multi-Region 3-Tier Infrastructure (EC2 + RDS)

This repository builds a **multi-region, production-grade 3-tier architecture** on AWS using Terraform.

It contains:
- A **VPC with Bastion, ALB, EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** in one region
- A **MySQL RDS instance with Multi-AZ failover** in a different AWS region
- Complete infrastructure automation using Terraform with modular code

This project is organized into two logical folders:

| Folder | Region | Components |
|--------|--------|------------|
| `PRIMARY-US-east-1/` | `us-east-1` | VPC, ALB, Bastion, EC2 ASG |
| `SECONDARY-US-west-2/` | `us-west-2` | RDS MySQL (Multi-AZ) |

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Terraform v1.6+**
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS
- **Regions Used:**
  - `us-east-1`: App tier (Bastion, ALB, EC2 ASG)
  - `us-west-2`: DB tier (RDS MySQL Multi-AZ)

### 🧱 AWS Services

- VPC, Subnets (Public/Private)
- Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- EC2 Launch Templates, Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
- RDS MySQL (Multi-AZ)
- IAM Roles, Security Groups
- Bastion Host
- Route Tables, Key Pair (optional)

## ✅ Features

- 🔁 Multi-region architecture for high availability and disaster recovery
- 🛡️ Layered security using public/private subnets and Security Groups
- ⚙️ Modular Terraform code (you can reuse the components)
- ☁️ Auto Scaling with Launch Template for EC2 instances
- 🧩 RDS deployment in a separate region to mimic DR scenarios
- 🔐 SSH bastion access to private subnets
- 📦 tfvars support for easy customization

## ⚙️ Deployment Instructions

### 🔑 Prerequisites

- Terraform v1.6+ installed
- AWS CLI configured with credentials (`aws configure`)
- Optional: your SSH key pair created and added to EC2 settings

### 🚀 Deploy Infrastructure

**Step 1: Deploy App Tier in `us-east-1` (PRIMARY)**

```bash
cd PRIMARY-US-east-1/
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

cd ../SECONDARY-US-west-2/
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
